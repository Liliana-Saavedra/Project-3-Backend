# Welcome to Tuned In :headphones:

## Overview :book:
Our application helps users document and reflect on their live concert experiences. After logging in via OAuth2, users can record concerts by selecting artists and venues through search, submit setlists, highlight favorite songs, and upload photos. This information is stored in their personal profile and visualized through a dashboard that tracks attendance patterns and genre trends. Users can explore their concert history through filters by artist, location, date, or genre, and compare setlists across tour dates. The system also delivers location-based notifications when previously attended artists announce nearby performances. Additional features include search-assisted data entry, photo uploads, and activity summaries. Users can easily track and reflect on their music experiences. Our app helps users keep track of their concerts and share the music moments that matter most.

## Why does this app matter? :bulb:

* What They Saw :camera_flash:

* How It Felt :heart:

By logging concerts, uploading setlists and photos, and tracking trends over time, users can build a personal music history that grows with them. It’s like a digital scrapbook for your concert life.
